## My process

I wanted to try my hand at using Svelte 5. I broke down each of the sections of the application into its components and then built them seperately. Using mobile first design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev//) - UI Framework

### What I learned

I learned how to use the Svelte runes such as $state() and $props().

### Continued development

I just want to continue using Svelte and eventualy master the framework. I really enjoyed the development process.

### Useful resources

- [Syntax: Svelte 5 Basics - Complete Svelte 5 Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/8DQailPy3q8?si=aVzRqMIPSGzSwLE0) - This helped me learn the basics of Svelte. I really enjoyed how Scott Tolinksi presented the concepts and will continue to learn with his and Syntax.fm resources.
